# Career Reboot Plan

This is a 90-day rebuild plan designed to transition me from an underperforming developer to a high-confidence, end-to-end system builder. It's structured around real-world delivery simulations, aggressive feedback loops, and public accountability.

**Goal:** Prove that I can scope, architect, and ship maintainable systems across web, mobile (React Native in Phase 4+), and APIs.

---

## 1. My Ideal Role

### What kinds of tasks energize me?

I thrive when given a clear mission, constraints, and the freedom to execute. I operate best in high-autonomy roles where precision and systems thinking are rewarded.

### What have others consistently praised me for?

Even in high-pressure or ambiguous situations, I stay calm, take feedback seriously, and adapt fast. I've rebuilt my habits to reflect this in code, systems, and communication.

## 2. 90-Day Technical Rebuild Plan

### Target Role + Niche

**Role:** I help early-stage startups and SMEs design, build, and optimize complete systems across web, mobile, and APIs. I specialize in diagnosing broken projects, scoping delivery with clear estimates, and executing maintainable high-performance systems.

**Niche:** eCommerce tools / marketplace

### Top 3 Technical Gaps to Close

1. System design weakness: inability to architect scalable, modular systems upfront
2. Execution speed: delivery delays under pressure
3. Debugging and refactoring: struggle to fix legacy systems, unclear mental models for optimization
